## 🧪 Sample Conversation

> 👤 **User**: I don’t feel interested in anything these days.
> 🤖 **Chatbot**: I’m really sorry you’re feeling that way. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Could you tell me how often you've felt like this over the last 2 weeks?

> 👤 **User**: Almost every day.
> 🤖 **Chatbot**: Thank you for your honesty. That sounds difficult. I'm here to help you explore how you're feeling, one step at a time.

> *(… continues through 9 questions)*

> 🤖 **Chatbot (Final)**: Based on your responses, it might help to try daily mindfulness or reach out to a trusted person. If this feeling persists, I recommend talking to a mental health professional. You’re not alone, and support is available 💙
